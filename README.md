# Cpp-Learning-Journey
# 🚀 MyCppJourney

Welcome to my **C++ learning journey**! 💻✨  
This repository contains all the codes I wrote while learning **C++ from scratch to advanced**. I followed the **YouTube playlist "Code with Harry"** and practiced everything hands-on.  

C++ is my **first programming language**, and I chose it because it is the **mother of all programming languages**. Learning C++ first gives a **strong foundation** that makes learning other languages like Python 🐍, Java ☕, and more much easier in the future.  

During my **first semester of Software Engineering**, I studied **Programming Fundamentals**, where I was introduced to C++. I continued learning through the "Code with Harry" playlist, writing all the code myself, and gradually moving from **beginner to advanced topics**.

### 📚 What you will find in this repository:
- ✅ **Basics:** Variables, operators, loops, conditional statements  
- ✅ **Functions & Recursion**  
- ✅ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Constructors, Destructors  
- ✅ **Dynamic Memory Allocation**  
- ✅ **File Handling**  
- ✅ **Templates & Function Templates**  
- ✅ **Standard Template Library (STL):** Vectors, Sets, Maps, Stacks, Queues, Deques, Algorithms  
- ✅ **Function Objects (Functors)**  
- ✅ **Advanced topics:** Virtual functions, Abstract classes, Runtime Polymorphism  

💡 **Why this repository is important:**  
Starting with C++ builds a **solid programming foundation**. Understanding memory management, pointers, OOP, and advanced C++ features early on makes learning other programming languages much faster and smoother.  

This repo is organized **sequentially**, from beginner-friendly code like `Hello World` 👋 to advanced C++ concepts. Perfect for anyone who wants to **learn C++ the right way**, step by step!  

### 🌟 Fun Fact:
C++ is not just a language; it’s a **superpower for developers**! 💪 Learning it first gives you control over **memory, performance, and system-level programming**, which most high-level languages abstract away.  

Happy coding! 🚀
