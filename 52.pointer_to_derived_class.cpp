/*
    This program demonstrates **pointers with base and derived classes**:

    1. Base class pointer pointing to a derived object:
       - Can access only members of the Base class.
       - Cannot access members defined only in Derived.
       - If the function is not virtual, calling it via Base pointer uses Base class version.

    2. Derived class pointer:
       - Can access both Base and Derived class members.
       - Calls the derived version of functions if overridden.
